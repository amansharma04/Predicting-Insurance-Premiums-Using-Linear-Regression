Predicting Insurance Premiums Using Linear Regression
Ever wondered how your lifestyle choices affect your insurance costs? This project uses a clever math technique called "Linear Regression" to predict insurance premiums based on three simple factors: BMI (a measure of body weight), sex, and smoking habits.
This open-source project leverages the power of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to provide accurate predictions for insurance premiums. Whether you're an insurance professional, data scientist, or just curious about how insurance premiums are determined, this project has something valuable to offer.
